Dairy products can also get in the way of iron absorption. While it is important to get the nutrients in dairy, if you have [iron deficiency anemia](https://www.verywellhealth.com/iron-deficiency-anemia-overview-4797984), eat dairy at a different time of day than you eat iron-rich foods to maximize your absorption of iron.\\n\\n### Lifestyle Changes\\n\\nOnce you have made some changes to your diet and are getting adequate nutrition, there are some other lifestyle strategies you can use to increase your red blood cell count and keep it at a healthy level.\\n\\nIt should be noted that strategies like exercising and avoiding alcohol will only be effective if you are already getting the nutrients your body needs to make enough healthy red blood cells.\\xa0That's why it is key to improve your diet first.\\n\\n### What Happens When I Eat Extra Nutrients?\\n\\nEating more than the recommended amounts of key nutrients will not increase your red blood cell count beyond optimal levels; Your body typically gets rid of excess nutrients it does not need or use.\\n\\nHowever, you can build up too much of certain nutrients, either through diet or supplementation. For example, if you are trying to increase your iron intake to fend off anemia, you should know that consuming too much iron can actually be dangerous.\\n\\nSpeak with your healthcare provider about the nutrients you should be getting each day, and the best method to include more in your diet, if necessary.\\n\\n## Causes and Treatment\\n\\nIf an underlying health disorder is causing your red blood cells to be low, you will need to have it treated.\\xa0There are many causes of a low red blood cell count.\\n\\nIn most cases, low red blood cell counts happen when your body is not making enough red blood cells or your red blood cells are getting used up or damaged. Common causes of low red blood cell count include:\\n\\nIn serious cases of low red blood cell count levels, a\\xa0[blood transfusion](https://www.verywellhealth.com/blood-transfusion-for-anemia-8624300) may be needed.\\n\\n### How to Get Your Red Blood Cell Count Checked\\n\\nYour healthcare provider can do a\\xa0[complete blood count (CBC)](https://www.verywellhealth.com/complete-blood-count-cbc-analyzer-8647862) to look at:\\n\\n## Symptoms of Low Red Blood Cell Count\\n\\n[Anemia](https://www.verywellhealth.com/anemia-7495917)\\xa0is the medical term for a low red blood cell count. It can also mean that your red blood cells are the wrong size (too small or too big), or they are otherwise not healthy and working as they should.\\n\\nThe signs and symptoms of low red blood cell count can be mild to severe. They may come on quickly or slowly over time, depending on\\xa0how low your numbers are\\xa0and your overall health.\\n\\nCommon symptoms of low red blood cell count include:\\xa0\\n\\nSevere anemia can cause:\\n\\nIf it goes on without treatment (as with an undiagnosed underlying condition) or a person loses a lot of blood quickly (for example, due to injury), not having enough red blood cells can lead to organ failure and death.\\n\\n### When to See a Healthcare Provider\\n\\nYou should see your healthcare provider if you have any symptoms of low red blood cells.

Increasing exercise levels and reducing alcohol intake may also help.\\n\\nRBCs, also known as erythrocytes, are the most common type of cell in the blood. They are responsible for delivering oxygen to tissues throughout the body, and transporting carbon dioxide back to the lungs. RBCs contain a protein known as hemoglobin, which binds to oxygen.\\n\\nWhen RBC levels are low, it can affect the body’s ability to transport oxygen. This can cause symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness.\\n\\nThe cause of low RBC levels can vary, and some causes require medical attention. In some cases, a person may be able to manage their RBC levels through certain lifestyle changes.\\n\\nIt is best to first contact a doctor if there are concerns about low RBC levels. The doctor can help determine the cause of low RBC and advise on suitable treatments, which may include dietary and lifestyle changes.\\n\\n### A note about sex and gender\\n\\nSex and gender exist on spectrums. This article will use the terms “male,” “female,” or both to refer to sex assigned at birth. [Learn more.](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/232363)\\n\\n## Diet changes that may help increase a low RBC count\\n\\nA low RBC count usually occurs when a person does not eat enough essential nutrients. Eating more nutrient-dense foods can give the body the necessary tools to create functional RBCs.\\n\\nPeople can also take these essential [vitamins](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/195878.php \"What are vitamins, and how do they work?\") and minerals as supplements, although it is best to get nutrients from foods in the diet if possible. It is best to consume foods that provide the following nutrients:\\n\\n### Iron\\n\\nIron deficiency anemia is the most [common form](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency-anaemia/) of anemia. The body uses iron to make hemoglobin, which stores oxygen in the blood cells. Without [iron](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287228.php), these cells may die or become unable to send oxygen around the body.\\n\\nEating foods with plenty of iron can help prevent symptoms of [anemia](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158800.php \"Everything you need to know about anemia\") and bolster the making of hemoglobin. Good sources of iron [include](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/):\\n\\n### Vitamin B12\\n\\n[Vitamin B12](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/219822.php) is [important for brain function](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-Consumer/) and creating new RBCs. Low vitamin B12 levels can prevent RBCs from fully maturing.\\n\\nA B12 deficiency [can trigger](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537254/) the development of abnormal RBCs called megaloblasts, which may lead to a condition doctors call megaloblastic anemia.\\n\\nVitamin B12 binds to protein in food and naturally occurs in [red meat](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/dairy-products-may-protect-against-type-2-diabetes-but-red-and-processed-meat-raise-risk/), fish, and shellfish. Dairy products such as milk and cheese also contain vitamin B12.\\n\\nManufacturers often fortify breakfast cereals, [milk substitutes](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/273982.php), and [nutritional yeast](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323245/) with vitamin B12. Eating these foods can supplement a person’s daily intake, particularly if they do not eat meat or dairy.\\n\\n### Vitamin B9\\n\\nVitamin B9 is also known as [folic acid](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/219853.php \"What to know about folic acid\") or [folate](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325310/). It is an essential nutrient for the nervous system. [Folate](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287677.php \"Why is folate good for you?\") also helps to create new cells in the body.\\n\\nPeople with low levels of folate may develop anemia. [Foods high in folic acid](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-Consumer/) include:\\n\\n### Vitamin C\\n\\nWhile [vitamin C](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/219352.php) does not directly affect RBCs, it is still important because it helps the body absorb more iron. Iron increases the body’s ability to make RBCs.\\n\\nVitamin C occurs in a [variety](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325067) of foods, [including](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-Consumer/):\\n\\n### Copper\\n\\n[Copper](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/288165.php) is an essential mineral that helps the body use iron in the blood. If someone is deficient in [copper](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/copper-iud/), their body may have [difficulties](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29959467/) utilizing iron for functioning, and they may develop an imbalance of the level of iron in the body.\\n\\nThe following foods are [good sources of copper](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper-Consumer/):\\n\\n### Vitamin A\\n\\nRetinol, also called [vitamin A](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/219486.php), appears to support a person’s RBC count by working with iron. Vitamin A may help the body to better utilize iron by helping it move into hemoglobin within RBCs.\\n\\nFoods that can supply vitamin A [include](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminA-Consumer/):\\n\\n## Lifestyle changes that may help increase a low RBC count\\n\\nMaking simple lifestyle changes can have a significant impact on a person’s RBC count.\\n\\n### Reducing alcohol consumption\\n\\nIt may be helpful to eliminate or reduce drinks containing alcohol from the diet, as drinking too much alcohol may lower a person’s RBC count.\\n\\nAccording to [Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020 to 2025](https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf), moderate drinking for adult males is two or fewer alcoholic drinks a day. For adult females, moderate drinking is one or fewer alcoholic drinks a day.\\n\\n### Exercising\\n\\nModerate [exercise](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153390.php) can provide benefits for any person who practices it. However, it is especially important for creating healthy RBCs.\\n\\nSustained vigorous exercise that raises the heart rate increases the body and brain’s need for oxygen. This is why the heart beats faster, and the lungs breathe deeper and quicker.\\n\\nThis need for oxygen stimulates the body to [produce more hemoglobin](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cphy.c180004). Regular exercise alongside a balanced, nutritious diet means the [bone marrow](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/285666.php \"All you need to know about bone marrow\") has the best tools to create those cells.\\n\\nPossible workouts include:\\n\\nHowever, even taking the stairs instead of an elevator, going for a walk, or doing some gardening can count toward a daily or weekly exercise requirement.\\n\\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) recommends engaging in [150 minutes](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/go-red-get-fit/what-exercise-is-right-for-me) of moderate to intense physical activity each week.\\n\\n## When to contact a doctor\\n\\nIn some people, dietary and lifestyle changes will not be enough to manage RBC levels.\\n\\nA doctor may prescribe certain medications to stimulate the production of RBCs.

This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and difficulty performing daily activities. While medical treatment is often necessary, diet and lifestyle changes can play an important role in managing symptoms and supporting overall health. Eating the right foods and making small adjustments to daily habits can help the body maintain better energy levels and improve red blood cell production.\\n\\n## How nutrition supports anemia management\\n\\nA well-balanced diet provides essential nutrients that help the body produce red blood cells. Iron, vitamin B12, and folate are especially important for maintaining healthy oxygen levels. Iron is needed to make hemoglobin, the protein that allows red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout the body.\\n\\nIron comes in two forms: heme iron, found in animal products, and non-heme iron, which comes from plant-based foods. The body absorbs heme iron more easily, but pairing non-heme iron sources with foods rich in vitamin C can help improve absorption. Vitamin B12, another essential nutrient, is primarily found in animal-based foods, but fortified options and supplements can provide alternative sources. Folate is also important for red blood cell formation and is in leafy greens, legumes, and citrus fruits.\\n\\nFurther, eating enough protein is essential. Lean meats, eggs, and plant-based proteins help the body maintain healthy red blood cells. Likewise, staying hydrated supports circulation and allows oxygen to reach tissues more effectively.\\n\\n## Lifestyle habits that can make a difference\\n\\nAlong with appropriate nutrition, daily habits can influence how the body manages **anemia**. Physical activity, quality sleep, and stress levels all contribute to maintaining energy and supporting red blood cell production.\\n\\nPhysical activity does not have to involve high-impact workouts like kickboxing or sprinting five times a week. If patients incorporate regular movement and light exercises like walking and stretching in 15-minute intervals, they can improve circulation and help oxygen reach the muscles and tissues. People managing *anemia* may need to monitor their activity to avoid excessive fatigue, but incorporating the aforementioned exercises can help support overall health.\\n\\nSleep is just as important as physical activity. The body repairs and regenerates red blood cells during rest, so maintaining a consistent sleep schedule helps reduce symptoms of anemia like fatigue and weakness. Moreover, chronic stress can also interfere with nutrient absorption and immune function. Managing stress through deep breathing, meditation, or spending time in a calming environment may help improve overall well-being.\\n\\n## Nutrient deficiencies and their impact on anemia\\n\\nSometimes, even a healthy diet is not enough to meet the body\\'s nutritional needs. Certain medical conditions can make it difficult to properly absorb iron, vitamin B12, and folate. Blood tests can help identify deficiencies, and an oncologist may recommend appropriate dietary adjustments or supplements personalized for each patient.\\n\\nIn contrast, some foods interfere with nutrient absorption. High amounts of caffeine, calcium, or fiber may reduce the body\\'s ability to absorb iron effectively. Taking iron-rich foods or supplements with vitamin C while avoiding calcium simultaneously may improve absorption.\\n\\n## When to seek medical guidance\\n\\nAlthough dietary and lifestyle changes can help manage anemia, medical evaluation is important when symptoms persist. An oncologist can determine the cause of the condition and recommend appropriate treatments. If fatigue, dizziness, or shortness of breath continue despite making changes to nutrition, further testing may be necessary. Common tests include:\\n\\n* **Bone marrow biopsy.** If anemia is severe or unexplained, the oncologist may perform this procedure to check for conditions such as aplastic anemia, leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).\\n* **Complete blood count {CBC).** This is the most fundamental test for diagnosing anemia. It measures the hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, and other blood components to assess the severity of anemia and overall blood health.\\n* **Erythropoietin levels.** This test measures the hormone responsible for stimulating red blood cell production, which may be reduced in cases of kidney disease-related anemia.\\n* **Hemolysis tests.** Tests such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, and direct Coombs test help determine if red blood cells are being destroyed prematurely due to autoimmune disorders or other conditions.\\n* **Inflammatory and chronic disease markers.** Tests such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) assess inflammation levels, which contribute to chronic disease anemia in cancer patients.\\n* **Iron studies.** These tests evaluate iron levels, including serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation, to determine if iron deficiency anemia is present.\\n\\nNote that this list is not exhaustive. However, it is a great place for oncologists to start when determining the exact type of anemia one has and personalize a treatment plan.\\n\\n## Receive a comprehensive to manage anemia\\n\\nCombining proper nutrition, healthy lifestyle habits, and the help of an oncologist provides the most effective approach to managing anemia. Recognizing signs of nutrient deficiencies and seeking medical support when needed can further improve energy levels and overall well-being.

They contain a protein called hemoglobin, which is [responsible for](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/red-blood-cell) carrying oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.\\n\\nThe body produces millions of red blood cells each day in the bone marrow. They circulate around the body for about [120 days](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8006275/), then go to the liver and spleen, which destroy them and recycle their cellular components.\\n\\nA low red blood cell (RBC) count means you have a low number of red blood cells, a condition known as anemia.\\n\\nIf your RBC count is low, your body has to work harder to deliver oxygen throughout your body.\\n\\nKeep reading to learn more about how to increase your RBCs at home, how a doctor can help, and more.\\n\\n### What are the symptoms of anemia?\\n\\nSymptoms of anemia could vary for each individual. According to the United Kingdom’s [National Health Service (NHS)](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency-anaemia/), the most common symptoms of anemia may include:\\n\\n* [fatigue](https://www.healthline.com/health/fatigue)\\n* [headache](https://www.healthline.com/health/headache)\\n* [weakness](https://www.healthline.com/health/muscle-fatigue)\\n* [shortness of breath](https://www.healthline.com/health/dyspnea)\\n* [heart palpitations](https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-palpitations)\\n* [pale skin](https://www.healthline.com/health/paleness)\\n\\n[Anemia](https://www.healthline.com/health/anemia) may increase your risk of several health complications, so it’s important to speak with a doctor if you’re experiencing symptoms. They may order a complete [RBC count](https://www.healthline.com/health/rbc-count) to check your levels.\\n\\n## 5 nutrients that may increase red blood cell counts\\n\\nYour body needs certain key nutrients to produce RBCs. Meeting your daily requirements for these nutrients supports your body’s RBC production.\\n\\nHowever, it’s important to note that this won’t guarantee a higher RBC count. Anemia has [many causes](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/causes), and collective lifestyle and dietary habits are only one cause. Treatments for anemia will differ depending on the cause.\\n\\nAs part of your overall treatment plan, consider talking with a doctor or registered dietitian to make sure your diet meets the recommended intake for these nutrients:\\n\\n### Iron\\n\\nIron is [essential](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/) for the body to produce RBCs. According to the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/), it’s available from foods in two different forms:\\n\\n* **Non-heme iron:** This type is found in plant-based foods and those fortified with iron.\\n* **Heme iron:** This type of iron combines with a compound called protoporphyrin IX. Heme iron is available in animal-based foods.\\n\\nThe NIH notes that your daily iron needs may be [1.8 times](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Iron-HealthProfessional/) higher if you eat a vegan or vegetarian diet because your body can absorb more heme iron than non-heme iron. Heme iron is more bioavailable.\\n\\nThat said, non-heme iron is better absorbed when taken with foods high in ascorbic acid (vitamin C). Calcium-rich foods like dairy products may inhibit the absorption of both heme and non-heme iron.\\n\\nIron-rich foods include:\\n\\n* lean meat\\n* seafood\\n* poultry\\n* iron-fortified breads and cereals\\n* nuts\\n* spinach\\n* beans\\n* lentils\\n* raisins\\n\\nLearn more about [12 foods high in iron](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-iron-rich-foods).\\n\\n### Folic acid\\n\\nGetting enough B vitamins like [folic acid](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamin-b12-or-folate-deficiency-anaemia/) in your diet may be beneficial. Foods high in vitamin B9 (folic acid) [include](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-HealthProfessional/):\\n\\n* enriched breads and cereals\\n* dark, leafy greens like kale, spinach, collard greens, and mustard greens\\n* liver\\n* Brussels sprouts\\n* asparagus\\n\\nLearn more about [15 foods high in folic acid](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-high-in-folate-folic-acid).\\n\\n### Vitamin B12\\n\\nFoods high in vitamin B12 [include](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Vitaminb12-Consumer/):\\n\\n* meat\\n* poultry\\n* fish\\n* dairy products such as milk and cheese\\n* eggs\\n* fortified products such as cereals and nutritional yeasts\\n\\nVitamin B12 is found in animal and dairy products. If you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, you may need to take vitamin B12 supplements to meet the recommended allowance.\\n\\n### Copper\\n\\n[Copper](https://www.healthline.com/health/heavy-metal-good-for-you-copper) intake doesn’t directly support RBC production, but it can help your RBCs [access the iron](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051227622000346) they need to replicate. Foods high in copper [include](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper%20-HealthProfessional/):\\n\\n* shellfish\\n* liver and other organ meats\\n* whole grain products\\n* wheat bran cereals\\n* chocolate\\n* nuts\\n* seeds\\n\\n### Vitamin A\\n\\n[Vitamin A](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-a) also [helps iron](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900721003257) get to your RBCs. Foods rich in vitamin A [include](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Vitamina-HealthProfessional/):\\n\\n* fish\\n* eggs\\n* liver\\n* dairy products\\n* leafy green vegetables\\n* orange and yellow vegetables\\n* tomato products\\n\\nLearn more about [foods that are high in vitamin A](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-high-in-vitamin-a).\\n\\n### What foods should you avoid if you have low red blood cells?\\n\\nProteins found in certain foods, such as milk, eggs, and soybeans, [may impact](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7509542/) the absorption of certain nutrients when taken together, which could affect your RBC.\\n\\nIf you have anemia, consider limiting your intake of the following foods:\\n\\n* dairy products\\n* [alcohol](https://www.healthline.com/health/anemia/anemia-and-alcohol)\\n* tea and coffee\\n* pomegranate juice\\n* dark chocolate\\n* red wine grapes\\n\\nSpacing out your meals during the day could also help prevent issues with nutrient absorption.\\n\\n## 8 supplements that may increase red blood cell counts\\n\\nIf your diet alone does not provide enough nutrients, taking certain supplements may help increase your RBC production or support related processes in your body.\\n\\nAccording to the [National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/treatment), prescription supplements for iron and vitamin B12 may help treat some types of anemia. A doctor will discuss this with you based on your specific situation.\\n\\nIt’s important to note that some supplements can interact with medications you may be taking, so be sure to get a doctor’s approval before adding any to your regimen. The recommended allowance for some nutrients may also change during pregnancy or while breastfeeding (chestfeeding).\\n\\nNever take more than the recommended dosage found on the product’s label.\\n\\nSupplements a doctor may suggest include:\\n\\n### Iron\\n\\nIron deficiency commonly causes low RBC production, a condition known as [iron deficiency anemia](https://www.healthline.com/health/iron-deficiency-anemia).\\n\\nThe Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for females ages 19 to 50 years is [18 milligrams (mg)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/iron-healthprofessional/) per day. For males ages 19 to 50 years, the RDA is 8 mg per day.\\n\\nLearn more about [iron supplements for anemia](https://www.healthline.com/health/anemia/iron-supplements-for-anemia).\\n\\n### Vitamin C\\n\\nThis vitamin may help your body better absorb iron. The RDA for vitamin C is [90 mg](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminC-HealthProfessional/) for males and 75 mg for females ages 19 years and older.\\n\\nLearn more about [vitamin C supplements](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-benefits).\\n\\n### Copper\\n\\nThere may also be a [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29959467/) between low RBC production and [copper deficiency](https://www.healthline.com/health/copper-deficiency). For adults ages 19 years and older, the RDA for copper is [900 micrograms (mcg)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Copper%20-HealthProfessional/) per day.\\n\\n### Vitamin A (retinol)\\n\\nFor females ages 19 years and older, the RDA for vitamin A is [700 mcg](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Vitamina-HealthProfessional/) per day. For males ages 19 years and older, the RDA increases to 900 mcg.\\n\\n### Vitamin B12\\n\\nThe RDA for people ages 14 years and older is [2.4 mcg](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Vitaminb12-HealthProfessional/) of this vitamin per day.\\n\\n### Vitamin B9 (folate)\\n\\nFor people ages 14 years and older, the RDA for folate is [400 mcg](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Folate-HealthProfessional/) of dietary folate equivalents (DFEs). The DFE measurement is used because folate supplements are absorbed differently than food sources.\\n\\nThe RDA is higher for people who are pregnant or lactating because folate plays a key role in reducing the risk of neural tube defects and other complications. The RDAs are:\\n\\n* **Pregnancy:** 600 mcg\\n* **Lactating:** 500 mcg\\n\\nTalk with a doctor or dietitian to make sure you’re getting the right amount.\\n\\n### Vitamin B6\\n\\nThis vitamin plays an [important role](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB6-HealthProfessional/) in synthesizing hemoglobin, one of the proteins contained in RBCs. The RDA for adults ages 19 to 50 years is 1.3 mg for vitamin B6.\\n\\n### Vitamin E\\n\\nFor people ages 14 years and older, the RDA is [15 mg](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-HealthProfessional/) per day. [Vitamin E](https://www.healthline.com/health/all-about-vitamin-e) may [help protect](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6257141/) blood cells from damage.\\n\\n## Other lifestyle changes\\n\\nStaying physically active, such as getting [regular exercise](https://www.healthline.com/health/anemia-exercise), may be beneficial if you have anemia.\\n\\nA small [2017 study](https://www.ijmhr.org/ijpr.5.5/IJPR.2017.216.pdf) suggested that doing cardiovascular exercise for 30 minutes three times weekly, along with taking iron supplements, may be more effective at increasing RBC than only taking iron supplements.\\n\\nThat said, more research is needed on the possible benefits of exercising for RBCs.\\n\\n## How a doctor can help\\n\\nIn some cases, changes in diet or lifestyle alone aren’t enough to increase your RBC count. A doctor may recommend one or more of the [following treatments](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia/treatment):\\n\\n* medications to treat an underlying health condition, such as an autoimmune condition\\n* [blood transfusion](https://www.healthline.com/health/transfusion-therapy)\\n* [bone marrow transplant](https://www.healthline.com/health/bone-marrow-transplant)\\n* surgery to help stop [internal bleeding](https://www.healthline.com/health/internal-bleeding)\\n\\nA healthcare professional could help develop the best treatment plan for you.\\n\\n## The bottom line\\n\\nRBCs are important to your body. If a doctor suspects your RBC count is low, they can order a complete RBC count to check your levels.\\n\\nIf you receive a low RBC count diagnosis, a doctor may recommend a combination of prescription supplements, medications, or other treatments to return it to normal.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n### How we reviewed this article:\\n\\nHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

Ensuring good health and staying away from anemia, consuming foods rich in iron is highly advised to improve red blood cell levels while maintain appropriate function of the blood circulatory system.**\\n\\n### **Get to know blood circulatory system in the body**\\n\\nThe blood circulatory system delivers nutrients and oxygen to all cells in the body. The average amount of blood in adults is generally equivalent to 1/12 of total body weight. For instance, an adult weighing 60 kg. should have approximately 5 liters of blood in their body. Blood consists of main components, including plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Iron is considered an essential element for blood production. The body usually contains iron 40-50 mg/kg. Iron is found in red blood cells in the form of hemoglobin and stored in the liver and spleen. Red blood cell production, called erythropoiesis takes place in the bone marrow under the control of the hormone erythropoietin. They are responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to body’s tissues with an average life span of about 120 days. Our red blood cells are naturally destroyed by macrophages in the liver and spleen at 120 days of age. During destruction process, iron attached to red blood cells will be released back to the circulation system and reused as an important component for hemoglobin and new red blood cell production. Essential nutrients for red blood cell production are iron, folic acid and vitamin B12\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Iron deficiency and anemia**\\n\\nAnemia is defined as a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood. Different types of anemia have different causes. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. Lack of iron can result from not getting sufficient iron in daily diets, e.g. red meat and liver. Vegetarians and vegans might also pose a high prevalence of depleted iron stores. In fact, some vegetables act as iron absorption inhibitors. Recommended iron intake per day among individuals is affected by several factors, such as gender, age, growth and physical development, physiological factors, blood loss during menstruation, dietary restrictions and ongoing health issues. The median dietary intake of iron is approximately 10.4 mg/day for adult men and 9.4 – 24.7 mg/day for adult women.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Sources of iron and iron absorption**\\n\\nHinging upon iron absorption, iron can be categorized into 2 main forms:\\n\\n1. **Heme iron:** Heme iron is derived from animal sources that originally contain hemoglobin, such as red meats, liver, poultry, fish and seafood. The body can highly absorb the most iron from heme sources, up to 20-30%.\\n2. **Non-heme iron:** Non-heme iron can be obtained from plant foods, such as whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, leafy greens. Egg yolk and milk also contain non-heme iron. Nonetheless, this form is harder for the body to absorb. Absorption of non-heme iron is markedly influenced by concomitantly consumed dietary components in which enhancing and prohibiting factors play a critical role in absorption rates which only accounts for 3-5%.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Dietary planning on iron intake**\\n\\nVitamin C has been clearly proven to enhance iron absorption. It captures non-heme iron and stores it in a particular form that becomes more easily absorbed by the body. Foods high in vitamin C that should concurrently take with iron include citrus fruits, orange juice and lemonade.\\n\\n* If daily food contains meats less than 30 g/day or vitamin C less than 25 mg/day, iron absorption from foods is limited, only 3-10%.\\n* If daily food contains meats 30-90 g/day or vitamin C 25 -75 mg/day, iron absorption from foods slightly increases to 10-12%.\\n* If daily food contains meats greater than 90 g/day or vitamin C greater than 75 mg/day, iron absorption from foods is substantially enhanced to more than 15%.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Choose good sources of iron**\\n\\n**To ensure an adequate amount of daily iron intake, it is recommended to follow these tips:**\\n\\n1. Consume more iron-rich (heme) foods, e.g. meat, liver, internal organs of chicken, fish, shrimp or prawn and edible shells.\\n2. Maintain adequate amount of meat, 6-12 tablespoons a day, as it largely enhances the body to absorb non-heme iron from foods.\\n3. Regularly eat fruits up to 3-5 serving portions a day, especially citrus fruits high in vitamin C to increase iron absorption (non-heme form).\\n4. If possible, try to eat fresh iron-rich vegetable and fruits since vitamin C is easily destroyed by excessive heat from cooking.\\n5. Do not drink cow’s milk or soy milk together with meals or with iron supplements as calcium and phosphate in cow’s milk and soy milk can substantially reduce the rate of iron absorption.\\n\\n### For more information, please contact\\n\\n[#### Cardiology Clinic](/en/bangkok-heart/center-clinic/bht-cardiac-center/cardiology-clinic/overview)\\n\\n1st Floor, Bangkok Heart Hospital\\n\\nService Hours:\\xa0  \\nMonday -

Problems with red blood cells can be caused by illnesses or a lack of iron or vitamins in your diet. Some diseases of the red blood cells are inherited.\\n\\nDiseases of the red blood cells include many types of anemia. This is a condition in which there are too few red blood cells to carry enough oxygen all over the body. People with anemia may have red blood cells that have an abnormal shape or that\\xa0look normal, larger than normal,\\xa0or\\xa0smaller than normal.\\n\\nSymptoms of anemia include tiredness, fast heart rate, pale skin, feeling cold, and, in severe cases, heart failure. Children who don\\'t have enough healthy red blood cells grow and develop more slowly than other children. These symptoms show how important red blood cells are to your daily life.\\n\\nThese are common types of anemia:\\n\\n* **Iron-deficiency anemia.** If you don\\'t have enough iron in your body, your body won\\'t be able to make enough red blood cells. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia. Causes of iron deficiency include:\\n\\n  + A diet low in iron\\n  + Sudden blood loss\\n  + Ongoing (chronic) blood loss, such as from heavy menstrual periods\\n  + Inability to absorb enough iron from food, such as from weight-loss surgery\\n* **Sickle cell anemia.** In this inherited disease, the red blood cells are shaped like half-moons rather than the normal indented circles. This change in shape can make the cells \"sticky\" and unable to flow smoothly through blood vessels. This causes a blockage in blood flow. This may cause sudden (acute) or chronic pain. It can also lead to infection or organ damage. Sickle cells die much more quickly than normal blood cells—in about 10 to 20 days instead of 120 days. This causes a shortage of red blood cells.\\n* **Normocytic anemia.** With this type of anemia your red blood cells are a normal shape and size. But you don\\'t have enough of them to meet your body\\'s needs. Diseases that cause this type of anemia are often long-term conditions, such as kidney disease, cancer, or rheumatoid arthritis.\\n* **Hemolytic anemia.** This type of anemia happens when red blood cells are destroyed by an abnormal process in your body before their lifespan is over. As a result, your body doesn\\'t have enough red blood cells to function. And your bone marrow can\\'t make enough to keep up with demand.\\n* **Fanconi anemia.** This is a rare inherited disorder in which your bone marrow isn\\'t able to make enough of any of the components of blood, including red blood cells. Children born with this disorder often have serious birth defects because of the problems with their blood. They may develop leukemia.\\n\\n**Medical Reviewers:**\\n\\n* Jessica Gotwals RN BSN MPH\\n* Ronald Karlin MD\\n* Todd Gersten MD\\n\\n© 2000-2025 The StayWell Company, LLC. All rights reserved.

Engaging in activities such as walking, swimming and cycling can be beneficial. If you have a blood condition or other health concerns, consult your doctor at HOAF before starting a new exercise routine to ensure it’s safe for you.\\n\\n## Manage Stress\\n\\nChronic stress can have a negative impact on your blood health, potentially affecting your blood pressure, immune response and overall well-being. It’s crucial to discover effective methods for managing stress to support overall health. Consider incorporating activities like meditation, yoga, deep breathing exercises and hobbies that you enjoy into your daily routine to reduce stress levels.\\n\\nAt HOAF, we understand that managing a blood disorder can be stressful. We offer comprehensive support to help patients navigate their treatment journey, which includes providing guidance on stress management techniques.\\n\\n## Monitor Your Blood Pressure and Cholesterol Levels\\n\\nMaintaining normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels is crucial for overall blood health. High blood pressure can strain your blood vessels, leading to complications, while high cholesterol can cause blockages that impede blood flow. Regular check-ups allow you to monitor these metrics, and if necessary, your healthcare provider can recommend lifestyle changes or medications to help manage them.\\n\\nHOAF provides comprehensive care and diagnostic services to help patients keep their blood pressure and cholesterol in check, reducing the risk of complications.\\n\\n## Avoid Smoking and Limit Alcohol Consumption\\n\\nSmoking is harmful to your blood health. It can impair your blood’s ability to carry oxygen and increase the risk of blood clots. Additionally, it damages blood vessels and raises blood pressure. Quitting smoking can greatly improve your blood health and reduce the risk of many blood-related conditions.\\n\\nExcessive alcohol consumption can also negatively impact blood health by interfering with the production of red blood cells and potentially leading to conditions like anemia. If you decide to consume alcohol, please do so in moderation. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/index.html), moderate alcohol consumption is classified as a maximum of one drink daily for women and two drinks daily for men.\\n\\n## Stay Up to Date with Regular Check-ups\\n\\nRoutine check-ups and blood tests are essential for maintaining hematology health. Routine screenings can identify potential problems early, enabling prompt intervention. Blood tests can monitor various aspects of your health, including red and white blood cell counts, platelet levels and other important markers that might indicate a blood disorder.\\n\\nAt HOAF, we encourage patients to schedule regular check-ups to ensure their hematology health is properly monitored. Our expert hematologists are equipped with advanced diagnostic tools to detect and manage blood disorders effectively.\\n\\n## Understand and Follow Your Treatment Plan\\n\\nIf you have been diagnosed with a blood disorder, adhering to your treatment plan is critical for managing your condition. This may include taking prescribed medications, attending follow-up appointments and making recommended lifestyle changes. By following your healthcare provider’s guidance, you can help control your symptoms and improve your quality of life.\\n\\nOur team at HOAF understands that managing a blood disorder can be challenging.

Cancer and its treatment can lower the number of RBCs and the hemoglobin level in the blood. Hemoglobin is the part of the red blood cell that carries oxygen.

A child has anemia if the hemoglobin is 75 g/L or less. Symptoms of anemia may develop even if the hemoglobin is higher than these levels.\\n\\n## Causes\\n\\nAnemia can be caused by:\\n\\n* lower RBC production\\n* destruction of RBCs\\n* blood loss due to too much bleeding\\n* malnutrition\\n* low levels of iron, vitamin B12 or folic acid\\n* some chronic diseases such as kidney disease\\n\\nCancer or cancer treatment (such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy) can affect the bone marrow so that it doesn’t make enough healthy red blood cells.\\n\\nEach type of blood cell lives for a certain amount of time. The body constantly breaks down and replaces red blood cells. Certain diseases or immune system reactions to blood cells can speed up this process so too many red blood cells are destroyed.\\n\\n## Symptoms\\n\\nSymptoms of anemia can vary. It tends to develop slowly in people receiving cancer treatments. A variety of symptoms can occur when hemoglobin levels are low and body tissues don’t get enough oxygen.\\n\\nSymptoms of anemia include:\\n\\n* fatigue\\n* lack of energy\\n* malaise\\n* pale skin, especially noticeable around the lips and nail beds\\n* dizziness\\n* weakness\\n* shortness of breath\\n* increased or irregular heart rate\\n* low blood pressure\\n* chest pain\\n* feeling cold or chilled\\n* headache\\n* poor appetite\\n* difficulty concentrating\\n\\n## Diagnosis\\n\\nYour doctor will try to find the cause of anemia. This may include asking questions about your symptoms and medicines and treatments you are taking. Your doctor may also do a physical exam.\\n\\nYou may need to have the following tests:\\n\\n* Blood tests are used to check the level of RBCs, hemoglobin, hematocrit, iron and vitamin B12.\\n* [Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy](/en/treatments/tests-and-procedures/bone-marrow-aspiration-and-biopsy#ci_bone_marrow_aspiration_and_biopsy_89_3963_00) may be done to find out what is causing anemia if other tests don’t show any abnormalities.\\n\\n## Managing anemia\\n\\nOnce the cause of anemia is known, your healthcare team can suggest ways to treat it. Treatments will depend on the cause of anemia.\\n\\n### Supplements\\n\\nYour doctor may prescribe medicines to help correct low levels of iron, vitamin B12 or folic acid. Take iron pills or other medicines as prescribed by your doctor.\\n\\n### Blood transfusions\\n\\nYou may need blood transfusions to relieve symptoms such as shortness of breath. More than one blood transfusion may be needed to correct the underlying cause of anemia. They may be given until the bone marrow can replace RBCs.\\n\\n### Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs)\\n\\nColony-stimulating factors are special medicines (growth factors) that stimulate the bone marrow to make red blood cells.\\n\\nErythropoietin is a hormone made by the kidney. It is involved in making red blood cells. The drugs epoetin alfa (Eprex, erythropoietin) and darbepoetin (Aranesp) are erythropoietin products that may be given to treat anemia. These drugs increase RBC production so that people with anemia may not need blood transfusions. They improve the quality of life for many people with anemia related to cancer. These drugs don’t work as quickly as a blood transfusion. It may take 2–8 weeks before someone starts to benefit from CSF treatment. However, the body’s response to these drugs usually lasts longer than a blood transfusion.\\n\\n### Rest\\n\\nGet plenty of rest to keep up energy levels and help you cope with anemia and its effects.\\n\\nAvoid strenuous or long periods of activity. Schedule rest breaks throughout the day. Prioritize activities and do those that are most important.\\n\\nMove slowly to avoid getting dizzy. When you get out of bed, sit on the side of the bed for a while before standing up.\\n\\nEat a balanced diet that includes foods high in iron.
